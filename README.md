# MScThesis

This GitHub repository serves the purpose of my MSc thesis Appendix section. More information and the full code is provided to complement the original report.

## Code
This directory contains all the java code classes with the associated depedency pom.xml file to run the application. In addition to this, it contains a README.pdf that contains a detailed runthrough explanation on how to run the code

## Iteration one/two
These directories contain the report that I produced to EngineB's Knowledge Engineer and Auditor to examine the findings that I collect and received valuable feedback that enhanced my future work

## Testing-Comparison
This folder contains multiple screenshots that proves the application is working how it is supposed.
### Sub-directory (Algorithm-Comparison)
In here you can find screenshots that compares all the algorithms between them and presents that they obtain equivelant results

### Sub-directory (System-Comparison)
In here you can find screenshots of the NEuler default implementation and Java source code comparison, it proves that both applications obtain the same exact results.

## Thank you for the interest.
